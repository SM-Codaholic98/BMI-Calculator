# BMI-Calculator

The CLI BMI Calculator is a straightforward command-line tool built in Python that computes Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters). It swiftly provides the calculated BMI value along with a classification indicating whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
